Tax game created by oTree, a python based framework for experimental games
#description
This experimental game was created to understand unethical behaviors from a gender perspective. Real-life corporate scandals are one of the crucial problems the world economies challenges. 
Subjects start the game with a survey when they answer basic demographic questions. One of these questions is about the gender status of the participant, which is vital for grouping in the next section. 
For the second part of the experimental design, I used a variant of the tax game introduced by (Fochmann et al. 2021), in which subjects only played the game once, either in a male or female dominant group. 
During the game, participants were grouped with two other randomly selected subjects depending on the majority groups they are randomly located and, together, behaved as accountant workers of a fictitious company.
Their duty is to declare the companyâ€™s income to the tax authority. In the end, they receive a payoff depending on their declared corporate income.
